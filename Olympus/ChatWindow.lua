-- The Olympus chats in the Olympus window (1.1.1): its Chat tab, right after the Realm (UI.lua's
-- TABS). The three chats ([Olympus], [Captains], [Lords]) like the chat pane of the Guild &
-- Communities window: the tabs' search box where the other tabs show the army's counts, and on
-- that row, right of it, a small switch of the channels (only for a rank that reads more than
-- one: most players read [Olympus] alone, and a row of its own for one lone channel took the
-- lines' room) and the settings' gear; each line whole in a bubble that wraps (nothing to hover to
-- read it) from under that row over the list's and the detail box's room, the 100 lines Channels
-- keeps per channel to scroll back through, a box to write in across the bottom where they have
-- their buttons (no Send button: Enter sends), and Olympus's marks by each name (the King's crown,
-- the High Council's mark, the Lords' and Captains' elite marks, Raiders and Veterans bronze, the
-- members' star, the Treasurer's coin, Stewards and Hands).
--
-- The first 1.1.1 build had it in a window of its own; the author wanted it inside the Olympus
-- window. UI.lua hands this file the window in use and where each part goes in its look
-- (ChatWindow.Attach), and the old window's calls stay as the ways to the tab: Open, Toggle and
-- Close (/ol, /olc or /oll alone, /oly talk and the minimap button's Shift-click) open the
-- Olympus window on its Chat tab, on the channel asked for, and close it. The
-- Realm tab's "Olympus chats" page it replaces is gone (the author's call): what that page offered
-- and the tab did not (the Olympus tab's state, the chats on or off with what that means, the
-- public channel's line, the pin for whoever may pin, the count of the lines the block terms hide)
-- is here, the most of it in the settings the gear opens in place of the lines, with each
-- channel's place in the game's chat (muted there or not, the chat window it goes to).
--
-- What it never does, whatever the input mode (mouse and keyboard, or Blizzard's gamepad UI):
-- - It never touches the game's chat boxes or windows: no script of theirs replaced or hooked,
--   and none opened from here (ChatFrame_OpenChat, ChatFrame_SendTell, ChatFrameUtil.*: they
--   write LAST_ACTIVE_CHAT_EDIT_BOX or CHAT_FOCUS_OVERRIDE, which the game's secure chat code
--   reads afterwards, so what the player types next runs tainted and /cast, /target, /use or
--   /click get blocked; with the gamepad UI that froze the game in 0.8.5). Every frame here is
--   Olympus's own. The Olympus tab of the game's chat (below) is made by the player, with the
--   game's own menu: Olympus only reads the game's chat windows to see it appear.
-- - Its box is Olympus's own EditBox: it never takes the keyboard by itself (SetAutoFocus(false)
--   the moment it is made, never focused on opening); the player clicks into it, with the mouse
--   or the gamepad cursor, or (mouse and keyboard, 1.1.1, the owner's ask) presses the game's
--   "Open chat" key while the tab shows: an override binding of Olympus's own button, below. Enter
--   sends through Channels.Send for an army chat, or ArenaChat.Send for a fight room, and the
--   cursor stays for the next line (an empty Enter, Escape or
--   a plain left-click elsewhere, the client's own, lets the keyboard go back to the game); with
--   the gamepad UI every Enter lets it go, as the Communities box does. It runs no command: a line
--   starting with "/" is kept and the player is told the game's chat box is where commands go
--   (and, with the cursor kept, that Escape and then his own key for it get him there).
-- - No game popup from it: the pinned line's takedown and a whisper go through ns.ShowDialog
--   (Olympus's own window with the gamepad UI); the Olympus window closes with Escape through
--   ns.EscapeCloses (nothing on UISpecialFrames with the gamepad UI: its X closes it there).
-- - Links in a line show their tooltip on hover (GameTooltip:SetHyperlink) and go into its own
--   box with a Shift-click; never SetItemRef, ChatEdit_InsertLink or HandleModifiedItemClick.
-- Nothing is drawn while the tab is hidden: a change marks it dirty and it redraws at most every
-- 0.2 s while shown (the census at most every 5 s).

-- The Olympus tab of the game's chat, by the player's own hand (1.1.1, the author's ask: a button
-- for it). Olympus cannot make a chat window: the game's code for one (FCF_OpenNewWindow, and the
-- NAME_CHAT popup FCF_NewChatWindow shows) writes the chat's own tables and its last active box
-- from whoever runs it, and run from an addon it taints the chat box (/cast, /target, /use and
-- /click typed there get blocked; with the gamepad UI the game froze). So the line on the Chat
-- tab only shows the player where: Olympus's own small pointer, anchored by the game's main chat
-- tab (ours anchored to theirs; theirs only read), says right-click it, Create New Window, name
-- it Olympus. Then Olympus reads the game's chat windows (Channels.FindTab: GetChatWindowInfo and
-- the frames' own fields) when the game says they changed (UPDATE_CHAT_WINDOWS,
-- UPDATE_FLOATING_CHAT_WINDOWS: FloatingChatFrame.lua and ChatFrameOverrides.lua register them)
-- and every LOOK_GAP while the pointer or the tab shows; the moment a window named Olympus is
-- there it runs Channels.SetupTab (the chats go there, and it says so once) and the pointer goes.
-- With the gamepad UI the game's chat tabs work otherwise: no pointer, the steps as text. With
-- Chattynator (1.1.2) its tabs are the chat and the game's are hidden behind them (the pointer
-- would point at nothing): no pointer, the click runs Channels.SetupTab at once, which says in
-- chat how to make the tab in Chattynator and sends the channels there the moment it exists
