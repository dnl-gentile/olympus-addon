-- The compliance gate (1.1.6): the only place that decides whether a wager may happen. A wager is
-- any stake of gold on an outcome: a bet on a fight, a Fight Night, a tournament or a Bones
-- table (the markets), a player's stake on his own duel or Bones game (direct, held by an
-- arbiter or from the wallet), a Lottery ticket bought with gold, and the payout of any of them
-- (the winner's share, the fee to the guild and the arbiter).
--
-- 1.1.6 ships the games without bets: duels, ratings, belts, tournaments, Bones against
-- another player or the House and the Lottery's practice table all play; no wager does, anywhere,
-- for anyone. Wagers are excluded from releases; dormant implementation is kept locally in case
-- that decision changes. Keeping the old region seam below does not schedule or enable a release.
--
-- Who asks it:
--   - every betting path, before it acts: placing or accepting a bet or a stake, opening a market,
--     buying a Lottery ticket, holding or paying out a stake, settling a market (Markets.lua,
--     MarketBank.lua, Stakes.lua, Lottery.lua, ArenaFights.lua, FarkleTable.lua);
--   - the arena's wire (ArenaNet.lua): Arena.Send refuses a type of Compliance.WIRE and Arena.Handle
--     drops one heard, so a 1.1.6 client never sends or takes a bet message, even from a modified
--     client; the types that also carry other things (a challenge, a Bones invitation, an
--     arbiter's ask) are refused by their own handler when they carry a stake or the crowd's bets;
--   - the arena's buttons (Arena.Can): an action of Compliance.ACTIONS is refused before its own
--     rule, so every screen greys it with Compliance.Line() as its reason.
-- Refunds are not wagers: gold going back to whoever gave it is never refused here.
--
-- The dormant region seam (not enabled in a release). Its table shape is:
-- REGIONS[region] = { minAge = n, [kind] = true | { [game] = true, ... } }, where
-- region is the code the player declared (a US state "US-WA", a country "BR", "DE", ...), kind one
-- of Compliance.KINDS and game one of Compliance.GAMES (true: every game of that kind). The player
-- declares his region and age once (Compliance.Declared reads them; a player who never declared
-- gets no wager, and neither does one under the row's minAge). The other side of a wager is asked
-- too where the protocol names him (his client runs the same gate on what it receives). In 1.1.6
-- REGIONS is empty and Declared returns nothing: Allows is false for every kind.
