-- The elite borders (1.0.1, asked for on the community Discord): the game's own elite and rare
-- art, and Max's bronze frames drawn over it, around the portrait of an Olympus player on your
-- target and focus frames, and around your own portrait for your own rank, like Elite Player
-- Frame (Enhanced) but for other players too. `/oly borders on|off`, on by default.
-- 1.1.5 (the author's call): three tiers, all winged: the King gold, the High Council silver and a
-- guild master of an Olympus guild Max's bronze. The rank tiers of 1.0.1 (Lords gold, Captains
-- silver, Raiders bronze wings, Veterans bronze) are gone: new borders are to come, and one that
-- nearly everybody has is worth nothing. Any other member: the nameplate star alone, no border.
-- Then two without wings (1.1.5, the author's asks after the High Council's yes): Max's plain
-- bronze for the people a guild master names (Nominees.lua: up to 10 centurions and a
-- correspondent per council department, while they are of his guild), with a guild master's bronze
-- mark on nameplates and in the game's chat; and the game's plain silver for the dev's own
-- character (ns.AUTHOR on his realm group), on the unit frames alone: no mark of its own.
--
-- How, on Forever's unit frames (Blizzard_UnitFrame, the "Camelot" family: TargetFrameTemplate
-- and PlayerFrame): the game draws an elite or rare creature's border with BossPortraitFrameTexture,
-- a texture of the frame's TargetFrameContainer, set in TargetFrameMixin:CheckClassification
-- (GetBossPortraitFrameData gives the atlas and where it goes). Olympus leaves that texture alone:
-- it puts its own hidden textures on the same container, one per border, just above the game's
-- (same layer, one sublevel up), with the game's atlases (or Max's files, at the size and offsets
-- of the game's frames they were drawn over), sized and anchored once, out of combat. From then on
-- it only shows and hides them: Show and Hide are not protected for a texture (the client's API
-- documentation marks them protected for a frame only), so a target change in combat is fine.
-- The game's frames get no call from Olympus but those CreateTexture, and nothing written in them
-- but hooksecurefunc's hook, which keeps their CheckClassification secure.
-- After the game's CheckClassification on the target and focus frames (hooksecurefunc on the frames
-- themselves: the mixin's functions were copied into them when they were made) Olympus shows the
-- border of the unit again, so it follows every update the game makes.
--
-- The party's frames (1.1.5, the author's ask: in a group the portraits under your own had none):
-- Forever's PartyFrame (Blizzard_UnitFrame's Shared/PartyFrame.lua and Mainline/
-- PartyFrameTemplates.xml; Camelot overrides neither) takes its four PartyMemberFrameTemplate
-- buttons from a frame pool. Each has a 37 x 37 portrait (BACKGROUND) 7 px from its left and 6 px
-- from its top, and no container: Olympus's textures go on the member frame itself. Not over its
-- own art as on the target: the member's name is on that same frame, in the layer and sublevel of
-- its ring (both ARTWORK 0, its Name from 46 px in), where the target's is on a frame of its own
-- far from the art, and the art's top tip (the dragon's head) reaches some 5 px into the name. So
-- at ARTWORK sublevel -1: over the portrait, under the frame's ring, its name and the rest of its
-- art (the game's ring then over the border's inner edge). A border is the
-- target's art and offsets scaled by 37/58 (the target's portrait is 58 x 58, 26 px from its
-- container's right and 19 px from its top, Mainline/TargetFrame.xml) about the portrait's top
-- corner, and turned round as on your own frame (the portrait on the left): an atlas at the
-- client's own size of it (C_Texture.GetAtlasInfo) times 37/58, Max's file at its tier's size
-- times 37/58. The unit of PartyFrame.MemberFrame<i> (the key Blizzard gives the frame of
-- layoutIndex i) is party<i>. A member's border is worked out on GROUP_ROSTER_UPDATE when he is
-- new to his place (joining, leaving, places swapped: by GUID, so one who stays is not worked out
-- again), on his name or guild reaching the client, and on the census changes below; an empty
-- place is not worked out. One hook, hooksecurefunc on PartyFrame's InitializePartyMemberFrames as
-- on the target frame's CheckClassification, because no event says it: each time PartyFrame is
-- shown (the interface hidden and shown again: Alt+Z, a cinematic) it releases its four frames to
-- the pool and takes them back in no fixed order (CreateFramePool is the secure pool,
-- Blizzard_SharedXMLBase/Pools.lua:857: its ReleaseAll walks its frames in next()'s order, :235,
-- onto a stack its Acquire pops last in first out, :219), so a frame may then show another
-- member; after it each border goes to the frame now showing its member. While the borders are
-- off it forgets which frame shows whom, and works it out again when they are back. A frame's
-- textures are made once, out of combat (in combat: once it ends). The raid's frames have no
-- portrait: none there. Only with Forever's unit frames (a target, focus or player container
-- found): a client without them (Classic Era, Anniversary) may load the same pooled PartyFrame
-- (the shared Blizzard_UnitFrame TOC lists it for every game) with its own family's party art,
-- at other sizes; no border there.
--
-- The gamepad UI (Forever's controller mode): off there. Olympus leaves the game's frames alone with
-- the gamepad UI (0.9.8), and nothing offline can show that a hook in the target frame's update is
-- harmless to it (0.9.9: the world map looked harmless too). Logged in with the gamepad UI, Olympus
-- neither hooks nor makes textures; switched to it later, its textures hide at once and the hooks
-- (the target's and focus's, the party's) return without a call; back to mouse and keyboard, the
-- borders come back.
--
-- Cheap: a unit's border is worked out only when the target or focus changes (or who is in a
-- party member's place, GROUP_ROSTER_UPDATE), when its name or guild reaches the client
-- (UNIT_NAME_UPDATE, PLAYER_GUILD_UPDATE), or when the census report of its guild (or the High
-- Council's list, or for a councillor the council's names shown or hidden on the King's screen, or
-- whether a net-off word hides him: 1.1) changes, and only from lookups: its guild's report by
-- name, never a walk over every guild.
-- A character or a guild the moderators took off (net-off, Moderation.lua; 1.1, Konig's review)
-- gets no border and no nameplate mark: an Olympus player to nobody's eye.
--
-- The author's preview (1.0.0): his character holds no Olympus rank, so his own portrait shows
-- none of the borders he ships. `/oly borders test <tier>` (a tier's name, as /oly status prints
-- it) shows that border round his own portrait, turned round as a holder sees his own, and on his
-- target or focus frame while that is himself; never on a real party member's frame (they show
-- their own borders). Edit Mode's party frames (Esc > Edit Mode > Party Frames, shown with nobody
-- in their place: Mainline/PartyMemberFrame.lua, UpdateMember) are the one way he can see the party
-- borders without a party (1.1.5, the author's ask): while Edit Mode forces them shown, each empty
-- place shows the previewed border. Edit Mode is only read (its own getter, when the preview or the
-- party is worked out: the command, PartyFrame shown again), never hooked. `/oly borders test off`
-- ends it. His alone
-- (Workshop.Visible: his character, or his test build, as Asmon's and the Treasurer's views):
-- anyone else's command gets what /oly borders prints, and changes nothing. His screen alone:
-- nothing is sent, nothing is saved (a /reload forgets it), nobody else's border changes. It goes
-- through the same Refresh as a real border, so the same rules hold: none while the borders are
-- off or with the gamepad UI, the textures made once out of combat.
--
-- The nameplate marks (1.0.0, Nameplates.lua) come from the same facts and tiers (Borders.MarkOf),
-- and `/oly borders off` hides them with the borders. The author's preview shows its tier's mark
-- too, and has one tier of the marks alone: "member", the star (no border has it). So do the marks
-- in the game's own chat (1.1.5, Borders.ChatName below), from a sender's name.

--            master, and dropped when he stops being it), while the server gives the unit that

-- tier (Borders.MARK_OF, by Borders.MarkOfName's facts and trust rules): the King the game's gold
-- elite dragon (nameplates-icon-elite-gold), a High Councillor its silver one
-- (nameplates-icon-elite-silver) then the icon he picked (ns.CouncilIcon), a guild master of an
-- Olympus guild and the people he names (1.1.5) the bronze (the gold tinted as Nameplates.BRONZE),
-- any other member of an Olympus guild we can prove the star; nothing for anyone else. 14 px, as
-- the Chat tab showed them; an atlas the client lacks: the star.
-- Guild and officer chat (CHAT_GUILD_EVENTS, the author's call): the dragons alone, never the star.
-- Everyone there is of our guild, so a star would tell a guildmate nothing he does not know; the
-- King's gold, a councillor's silver and the guild master's bronze still tell who is who. (A
-- dragon the client has no atlas for, drawn as the star elsewhere: none there either.) The same
-- hook and the same arguments as every other line (Blizzard_ChatFrameBase/Mainline's
-- MessageEventHandler: GetDecoratedSenderName for every CHAT_MSG_ event, the sender the second
-- argument; for guild chat the name it decorates is Ambiguate's "guild" one).
-- (It began with the councillors' marks alone, in guild chat too, while Olympus's own lines carried
-- every mark. Olympus's own lines, Channels.FormatLine and the Chat tab, carry none since: the
-- name in its colour.)
-- No line of the game names its sender's guild, so his is a guild MarkOfName's rules can prove
-- (ChatGuilds): ours when our roster has him; the King's for the King, his Stewards and Hands by
-- their names; the one his own Olympus messages speak for (Data.ClaimedGuild: his lines on the
-- Olympus channel, his census reports, his board posts...), as the 1.1.1 Chat tab took the guild
-- his line named, and only when that guild's census names him (its guild master or an officer: a
-- plain member of another guild is in no census, so he gets no star here). Never a guild only
-- someone else's report names him in: any character can send a census report for any guild
-- named Olympus, so two of them could otherwise put the bronze on anybody's name in Trade (a
-- border or a nameplate mark needs the guild the server gives the unit). A High Councillor's
-- silver needs no guild: the signed list.
-- The game's hook for it, ChatFrameUtil.AddSenderNameFilter (Forever 1.60.1,
-- Blizzard_ChatFrameBase/Shared/ChatFrameFilters.lua): Blizzard calls it through securecallfunction
-- with the line's event, the name it decorated (class colour and all) and the line's arguments, and
-- shows what it returns inside the player link only; the link's data, the click, the right-click
-- menu, /r and the whisper window keep the real name. Nothing of Blizzard's is replaced, and a
-- client without it has no marks.
-- Off with the gamepad UI, as the borders: logged in with it, nothing is registered until a switch
-- to mouse and keyboard; switched to it later, the callback returns at once. Also none: outside an
-- Olympus guild (ns.IsMember, as the borders: a list kept from before says nothing there; asked
-- again on every marked line), a High Councillor's on the King's screen while the council's names
-- are hidden (ns.CouncilMasked: asked again on every line with a council mark, so a first login
-- whose guild was not known yet, or any other flip, never leaves one on his stream; his guild
-- master's bronze or the star there instead, if any), a character or a guild the moderators took
-- off (net-off), a secret name or sender, and `/oly chatmarks off` (ns.db.chatMarks false).
-- Blizzard runs the callback for every line on every chat window: it reads a boolean, the event
-- list and one table entry; a sender not seen yet is worked out once (ChatName: lookups only, at
-- most two guilds' census rows, never a walk over every guild), and the table is emptied every
-- CHAT_FORGET seconds and whenever the census, the council's lists, our guild or the council's
-- names hidden or shown change, so a new list or icon shows within a minute.
