-- The Missionary Church of Olympus (1.1.6): the Head of the Church, the Twelve Apostles, the
-- missionaries of their networks and each guild's Church correspondent. This file keeps the book
-- of who holds which place, the acts that change it, presence, the book's sync and the Church's
-- chat room. Counting the people they bring in is ChurchCount.lua's; the tab is ChurchView.lua's.
--
-- Who is who, as every client works it out from what it holds itself, never from a message:
-- - The roots: the author (Workshop.IsAuthorName) and Asmongold, the King and immutable Head of
--   the Church (ns.IsKingCharacter, with the existing faction and realm identity guards).
-- - The Twelve Apostles: the author's signed titles list names them in an entry of its own, one
--   per faction, with three "^" as the Steward's, so older clients leave it out unread:
--     ^apostles^<Alliance|Horde>^[*]<First Surname-Realm>,...     (Church.APOSTLES_MAX at most;
--   historical '*' remains readable but grants no Head authority)
--   It is the whole list as of its time: a root's acts in game change it only when newer.
-- - Missionaries: each under one parent, an Apostle or another missionary; the Apostle at the top
--   of his chain is his network. An Apostle or a missionary names missionaries under himself; a
--   root names one under the Apostle or missionary he picks. A parent names NAMES_PER at most (the
--   ones he adopted not counted), DEPTH_MAX levels below the Apostle, MISSIONARIES_MAX in all.
-- - One Church correspondent per Olympus guild, answering to the Head: named by that guild's guild
--   master or by a root; a new naming replaces the old one.
-- - The audience (the room, the tab, the numbers): the roots, the Apostles, the missionaries, the
--   correspondents and the High Council. The keepers (they serve the book and keep the ledger):
--   the Head, the Apostles and the author. The King's client does no background work beyond
--   handing his own acts to the keepers who were away (Church.DeliverActs).
--
-- A removal leaves a tombstone with the parent the person had. A missionary whose parent is a
-- tombstone climbs to that tombstone's parent; one whose parent holds no place and left no
-- tombstone (an Apostle a newer signed list left out, one this client never heard) is an orphan
-- under the Head. Both are marked for the Head's review. A cycle, a level past DEPTH_MAX or a
-- parent's quota or the total overflowed makes an entry invalid: it grants nothing (the Head's
-- own slot, where orphans and the ones he keeps sit, has no quota: the total bounds it). Every
-- client derives the same tree from the same entries, whatever order they came in (Church.State).
--
-- The wire. Every message is whole (never in pieces), at most 255 bytes, version 1. Clients before
-- 1.1.6 have no handler for these types and drop them unread (Comm.lua); a 1.1.6 client drops
-- any other version, kind or number of fields (Church.Stats().dropped).
--   NB~1~a~<op>~<role>~<target|->~<under|->~<guild|->~<at36>
--       an act, sent by the actor's own client on CHANNEL and GUILD, logged (his own word).
--       op: + names, - removes, k (a root) keeps an entry marked for review, m (a root) moves a
--       missionary under another parent. role: A (Apostle), M (missionary), C (correspondent; the
--       guild says which). under: the parent a root names or moves a missionary under. at36: the
--       server's clock, base 36. Each receiver checks the sender's power in its own book.
--       The same text again by WHISPER, from the actor's own client to each keeper it hears later
--       who was not heard when the act went out (OWN_ACT_KEEP at most, the newest act per place):
--       only a keeper takes it, as the act itself, with the same checks (Church.DeliverActs).
--   NB~1~s~<0|1>~<at36>      an authorized publisher's public ranking switch, CHANNEL/GUILD, logged
--   NB~1~q~<d1,...,d9>       an audience client asks one keeper (WHISPER) for the pages whose digest
--                            differs: P0..P7 (places and their tombstones by name), then C
--   NB~1~p~<kind>~<f1>~<f2>~<f3>~<f4>~<f5>~<at36>   one entry of a page, keeper -> asker (WHISPER):
--       A|M  <name>~<under|->~<actor>~<actor's role>~<since36|->  a place (since: when a kept or
--            moved missionary first held his place; "-" for any other)
--       X    <name>~<A|M>~<actor>~<actor's role>~<parent|->       a removal (tombstone)
--       C    <guild>~<name>~<actor>~<actor's role>~-              a correspondent
--       Y    <guild>~-~<actor>~<actor's role>~-                   a correspondent's removal
--       Entries on Apostles (A, X of an Apostle, and any entry for a name that is an Apostle in the
--       receiver's book) come only from a root's client (the author's or the Head's): an Apostle
--       can relay missionaries and correspondents, never change an Apostle's place.
--   NK~1~p~<role>~<book digest|->~<guild>~<switch|->   presence, CHANNEL and GUILD: role W K H A M
--       C N (N: a High Councillor); digests from keepers only; switches from keepers/publishers
--       (0 or 1 then its time, base 36). Only for whom to
--       whisper (the room, the desk) and who brought guildmates in: each receiver checks the role
--       in its own book. Actual publishers' switches are taken either way, and a closed one
--       from any keeper (closing is the private direction): a client that missed the publisher's
--       close learns it from the first keeper who heard it.
