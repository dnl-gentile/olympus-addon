-- 1.2: crafting requests (who can make an item?). A request is public only while it is a board
-- card, and the card says nothing of what follows: not who took it, not the terms, not the end.
-- A claim and every later word travel as logged addon whispers between the requester and the one
-- accepted crafter, and, on the guild-mediated rail, the named treasury keeper who holds the goods
-- and the gold (the custodian), or the reviewer a party asked to judge a dispute.
--
--   CQ~2~...  the board card: one logged CHANNEL message, the requester's alone
--   CR~1~...  a claim and the two parties' words (WHISPER, logged)
--   CJ~1~...  a line of the private request chat (WHISPER, logged)
--   CK~1~...  the mediated rail and the human review: parties, custodian, reviewer (WHISPER, logged)
--
-- Nothing here clicks Trade, Send or Take, fills a window, or pays on its own. Trade and mail
-- observations annotate the record. On the direct rail completion is always the requester's
-- explicit confirmation of the delivery the crafter recorded; on the mediated rail custody follows
-- the custodian's own observations of what reached him. Whatever has Olympus hold gold or owe it
-- on someone's behalf (the mediated rail, the Wallet adapter, the custodian's own payout and
-- refund debts) sits behind the switches of the Arena's live gold (Requests.GoldGate): off where
-- saved data does not survive, as the Wallet is.
--
-- The guild's 6% of a direct sale (the owner's answer) is the seller's own debt to the guild, in
-- the game's gold (never the Arena's chips), whatever the Arena's switches say: Olympus holds none
-- of it, it only records it. The seller owes it by a deadline and is warned once it is late (no
-- new claims until it is paid); both parties' clients tell the fee desk (the Treasurer's
-- characters, where the fee mail goes) of the sale, so the seller's own client alone cannot hide
-- it; the desk sees the fee mail land in its treasury book. A sale the buyer never confirms owes
-- it all the same, CONFIRM_WAIT on (the delivery the seller recorded, or a trade both addons saw),
-- unless a party disputed it. The Treasurer's characters and the King's, the High Council and the
-- author (the real ones, never a preview of anyone's view) read the debtors' ranking and every fee
-- owed, for the collection (the Treasurer's and the King's reminders) and the Watch's own ladder;
-- nothing here removes anyone. Only a fee the seller's own word confirms (or the desk confirmed by
-- hand) is ranked: the buyer's word alone, or a buyer's figure above the seller's, waits apart for
-- a human, the higher figure kept as the fee.
