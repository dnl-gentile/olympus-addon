-- The Blood Arena's core network (1.2): every arena message goes out and comes in through here.
--
-- The envelope. Every arena message is <type>~<mode><proto>~<body>: "AF~L1~...". The mode is L
-- (live) or T (a rehearsal, a test build); the protocol is 1, and a client drops any other. The
-- King's arena words are not enveloped: they are kinds of the King's T1 (ArenaRoles.lua).
--
-- The weight rule (the design). Until something involves this client (Arena.Involve: a duty, a
-- fight, a table, a ticket, a rehearsal, the open window), the arena creates no frame, registers
-- no WoW event and runs no timer: Arena.Every and Arena.After wait, the one arena ticker (1 s) is
-- stopped. The only cost of an idle client is its Comm.Handle entries, the small verification sets
-- and one PLAYER_LOGOUT handler that writes the persistence sentinel (Arena.Persists). Events a
-- send needs (the not-found system line, the lockdown recheck) are registered on first use, and
-- their handlers return at once when nothing expects them.
--
-- What this file owns (ns.Arena, the design): modes and stores (Mode, NewMode, Store, Heavy, Counts,
-- Lane, RealmOf), sending (Send, pieces over 255 bytes with their own assembler, the low lane, the
-- must-deliver retries (a refused piece again alone, else the whole payload again), the urgent
-- share, the per-target whisper outbox, a must-deliver whisper to a target offline kept until he
-- is back, the lockdown hold, the net-off hold on the whole payload),
-- receiving (Handle, Inject), the signature queue (Verify), parse helpers, involvement and its
-- ticker (Involve, Every, After, Changed), actions (Action, Can, Do), the /oly arena router (Slash,
-- RunSlash), the companion (LoadUI and its handoff), the test build, the kill switch, the sim switch,
-- the rules' yes, the persistence gate, the King's view and the stream delay, and the events
-- registry (Events.Register, EventOf). No arena file names the author (the design).
