-- anyone's report, and two characters on the leaked channel can make up a guild and its Lords),
-- the others wait for his click; nothing is sent before he hands it out. It goes where only its
-- receivers read it, never on the Olympus channel (public, or sealed with the key that leaked):
--   K3~<epoch>~<key>[~<h1.h2.h3>]
--                      by whisper from the King (or his Steward) to every Lord and Captain of the
--                      guilds he picked
--                      current authority confirms online (the census before explicit signed
--                      enforcement, the manifest afterwards) whom his own /who saw in that guild
--                      (Who.SeenGuild, the server's word; before enforcement two characters on the
--                      leaked channel can name themselves a real guild's Lord and Captain),
--                      and over GUILD from each of
--                      them (their officers) to their own guild; K1~<key> with it there, for
--                      guildmates before 1.1. The hashes: the keys it replaces (at most 3).
--   K4~<epoch>~<guild> a Lord's or Captain's addon tells the King it has it (a whisper); his
--                      Throne counts it only from a name his client whispered the key to, and
--                      under the guild it whispered him for (its own record), never the one named.
--   K5~<epoch held>    over GUILD, after login: a guildmate asks whether a newer key exists;
--                      an officer holding one answers with K3.
--   K7~<epoch>~<h1.h2> over GUILD: an officer deliberately returns his guild to the public
--                      Olympus channel. The hashes are the private keys this clears. Updated
--                      clients remember them, so an older client's delayed K1 cannot split the
--                      guild again. K7 never travels on the Olympus channel.
-- The epoch is the server's second the key was made (or an officer typed one, 1.1): every 1.1
-- client keeps the newest, and remembers the keys a newer one replaced (their hashes): a key
-- without an epoch (K1 alone, from an officer before 1.1) is taken as ever, unless it is one of
-- those. So a 1.0 officer's K1 of the leaked key no longer pulls his 1.1 guildmates back, and a
-- 1.0 officer who re-keys his guild by hand still moves all of it; an older key with an epoch
-- does not undo his re-key either. A K3 takes a whisper from the King's pinned name or a Steward's
-- (the signed list), or GUILD from our own officers (the server's roster), and never the channel.
-- Two rotations at once (the King's and a Steward's): every client keeps the newer epoch.
-- Whoever is in a guild that gets it has it too (its officers hand it to the whole guild): the
-- rotation leaves behind whoever holds the old key outside the guilds picked.
-- The King's client hands the key out a few whispers at a time, never more than the send queue
-- has room for (its other messages keep their place), and counts a whisper as sent once it left.
-- /who goes from a click alone: his click on a guild, or on the Throne's /who line, searches the
-- next one picked whose Lords and Captains it has not seen there yet, then each of them by name
-- (Keys.Confirm); with the gamepad UI his click on the /who line searches a guild picked plainly,
-- never a name. What it saw is kept with the rotation (rot.saw), through a /reload too.
-- It keeps handing it to Lords and Captains who come online for GRACE, on the old channel (a
-- little longer while some picked still wait for their whisper), then moves (with his guild);
-- "Move now" sooner. Guilds with no officer online in that time stay on the old channel until one
-- of theirs types the key by hand; the Throne says how many acknowledged. Older clients ignore
-- K3, K4 and K5.
-- 1.3.4 (the author's call, for the launch): the addon's author rotates and hands out the key too
-- (his characters, Workshop.IsAuthorName: the code's on the beta, the signed list's on a launch
-- realm group), King or not, Steward or not: he becomes neither. His Throne shows the rotation in
-- his own view (King.lua); a preview of another role (Asmon's view, View as) starts none. A K3
-- whispered by him is taken as the King's is; the same /who, guild picking and whispers to Lords and
-- Captains alone, never the channel.
-- 1.4.0 (the author, for the launch: a copy of an older version, or an older version itself, must not
-- reach the official channel): the key travels as K8 alone, the same fields as K3, wherever a K3 or a
-- K1 went (the whisper to Lords and Captains, the officers' hand-out to their guild, the answers to a
-- guildmate's K0 or K5, /oly key). Versions before 1.4.0 read neither K8 nor a channel they have no key
-- for: they stay off the sealed channel until they update. A K3 or K1 from an older officer is still
-- taken here. (A head start, not a lock: whoever copies 1.4.0's code reads K8 too.)
