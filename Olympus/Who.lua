-- The game's /who, shared by the Join screen (Olympus members online to ask) and the census
-- Refresh button (Olympus guilds nobody reports, seen online). One search per click: the
-- game only takes /who from a hardware event, so never from a timer, and at most one every
-- COOLDOWN seconds whichever button sent it. The Who button of our person panel keeps the
-- same distance from these (SendPlain).
--
-- Searching quietly. The answer (WHO_LIST_UPDATE) opens Blizzard's own who list: the Who tab
-- of the Social window on the old UI (FriendsFrame), the group finder's list on Forever's new
-- UI (LFGWhoListFrame, which shows LFGParentFrame on every update; the Social window there
-- does not listen), and ClassicUI Forever's list in the Social window. For our search only,
-- the ones that listen stop listening and get the event back with the answer, or after
-- TIMEOUT without one. Nothing of theirs is replaced or moved. With the player's own who
-- window open nothing is touched: the search is skipped, the answer would land in it.
-- A search given up before its answer (no answer by TIMEOUT, someone else searched) keeps
-- results going to the UI until that answer comes, see Release.
--
-- Past the cap. The server lists at most 50 players per search (MAX_WHOS_FROM_SERVER; on
-- Forever the total it reports stops at 50 too). When the broad search is capped, the next
-- clicks search level ranges and add what they find (one player once, by name: the server
-- lists some twice) until every range was searched once. The click after that starts over,
-- and so does one ROUND_TTL after the round began: its players have moved on meanwhile.
