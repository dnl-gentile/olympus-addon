-- 1.1.6: lighter punishments in Olympus's own chats (The Watch): a moderator deletes a
-- player's line, or all his recent lines, and gives him a timeout (5 or 30 minutes, the High
-- Council's ladder of 1 hour, 24 hours and 7 days, or until lifted: his account held while a case
-- about him is decided). Every 1.1.6 client replaces a deleted line with "[deleted by a moderator]"
-- (the name stays, greyed) in the Chat tab and its saved history, in the rooms, and, where the
-- game's source shows a safe way (WatchChat.ReplacePrinted), in the game's own chat windows; a late
-- copy of it is dropped (a tombstone), and a report never carries it. A timed-out player's new
-- lines are dropped on every 1.1.6 client (Channels.Admit: the three chats, the rooms and the
-- arena's fight rooms) and his own client refuses to send, telling him in an Olympus pop-up who
-- (the role, never the name), until when and why.
-- A sanction is more than the chat: while a timeout, a hold or a net-off word
-- (Moderation.lua, exile included) is on a player, for the same window his own client and every
-- 1.1.6 client that knows it bar him (WatchChat.Barred) from the powers Olympus gives him (The
-- Watch, net-off words, pins, the Throne's calls, the shared block terms), the Olympus games, the
-- map's positions with the King's position and whether the King is online, and the Crafting tab;
-- during a hold his wallet is frozen too (no bet, no withdrawal).
--
-- Who may act, worked out on every client from the name the server stamps (never from a message):
--   a Watcher (his guild's officers, the people its guild master names, a signed moderator:
--     Watch.IsAuthorized) on a member of his own guild below him (Watch.TargetAllowed), over GUILD;
--   the author (7), the King (6), a High Councillor (4) or an Olympus moderator one of them named
--     (3) on anyone in Olympus whose level is lower (WatchChat.ProtectLevel: a Steward 5, a Hand 4,
--     a guild master 3), on the Olympus channel.
-- Nobody acts on himself, on the pinned King, or through a linked alt on someone he may not reach.
