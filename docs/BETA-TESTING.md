# Testing an Olympus beta

An automated pass and an in-game pass are different evidence. Record both. A green
repository check means the Lua, fixtures and package invariants passed offline; it does not mean
that a World of Warcraft client, gamepad flow or exchange between real players was observed.

## 1. Build gate (automated)

Start from the exact commit to be tested, in a clean Git worktree. `package.sh` refuses tracked
changes and any untracked or ignored file under `Olympus/` or `Olympus_Arena/` that could enter a
zip.

```bash
git status --short
git diff --check
bash tests/check-scripts.sh
bash scripts/check.sh
node --test web/test/*.test.mjs
scripts/package.sh --test N
```

The last command writes four tester artifacts:

- `dist/Olympus-<version>-testN.zip`
- `dist/Olympus-<version>-testN.files.txt`, the sorted files in that zip
- `dist/Olympus-<version>-testN.sha256`, the zip's SHA-256
- `dist/Olympus-<version>-testN.txt`, install and rollback instructions

Review the manifest before distributing the zip. On macOS verify it from `dist/` with
`shasum -a 256 -c Olympus-<version>-testN.sha256`; on Linux use `sha256sum -c`.
Keep the test zip and its sidecars together. Test builds expire, identify their build and commit
in game, stay in their test group, and are not release files.

## 2. One Windows client (observed)

1. Quit World of Warcraft. Back up both addon folders and
   `WTF/Account/<ACCOUNT>/SavedVariables/Olympus.lua`. Keep the backup outside `Interface/AddOns`.
2. Verify the downloaded zip in PowerShell. The printed hash must equal the first field of the
   supplied `.sha256` file:

   ```powershell
   (Get-FileHash .\Olympus-<version>-testN.zip -Algorithm SHA256).Hash
   ```

3. Turn off automatic updates for Olympus while testing. Delete the installed `Olympus` and
   `Olympus_Arena` folders, then extract the zip directly into
   `<WoW flavor>\Interface\AddOns\`. Do not leave an extra zip-named directory around them.
4. Restart the game. Confirm the addon list shows the test number and `/oly arena status` shows
   the expected build, base version, lane and commit. Record any Lua error before continuing.
5. Walk the main windows at the tester's normal resolution and UI scale, then at one smaller
   scale. Check tabs, Back, scroll areas, hover help, overlays, portraits, close/reopen and combat
   transitions. Run the built-in simulation/UI tour where it is available.
6. Repeat the critical path with gamepad mode on, then turn it off during the same session. No
   protected game window should be forced and no taint or blocked-action error should appear.
7. Check `enUS`, `ptBR`, and at least one locale that intentionally falls back to English. Look
   for clipped labels, broken format placeholders and buttons narrower than their text.
8. `/reload`, relog, and restart the client. Record what persisted and what the client discarded.
   Use `/oly bug` and, after a reload or logout, `WOW_HOST=user@pc scripts/logs.sh` for the evidence.

Rollback is also an observed gate: quit the game, remove both test folders, reinstall the current
release from the addon app, restore saved data only if needed, restart, and confirm the release
version loads without errors.

## 3. Mixed-version and multi-account session (observed)

Use the same zip and SHA-256 on every tester. Use free games and a party or raid. Bets, gold
stakes, entry-fee pots and paid Lottery tickets are not part of a beta or release. Do not bypass
the gate to test dormant financial code on somebody's real character.

The minimum useful session has two participants, an organizer, a spectator, and one client on
the previous public release. Also keep one
non-participant outside the group. Record each character, version, role, client flavor, gamepad
state and join/leave time.

Exercise a complete successful cycle before the hostile cases. Then cover, without bypassing the
buttons and functions players really use:

- a late join, leave and rejoin; `/reload` and a client disconnect during an open session;
- an older client in the group and an older client outside it;
- an unauthorized action, a repeated click, duplicate result and attempted double recording;
- a stale or delayed action, actions arriving in a different order, and a session closed early;
- an unavailable participant, cancellation, disconnect and recovery;
- gamepad and keyboard users together, combat/instance transitions, ignore/block and rate limits;
- a ten-minute burst/soak with several simultaneous users, watching queues, memory and errors.

After each game, compare the players' results and history, then compare any permitted public
summary on the spectator. An unexplained difference is a failed gate, even when the UI looked
correct. Treasury contributions use their separate, normal manual mail/trade checks; they are
not game stakes or prizes.

For the 1.2.1 candidate, include these focused live checks:

- Bones: two players exchange Players messages, then switch to Everyone with a spectator.
  Private messages must never reach the spectator. Collapse/reopen the side panel; keep an
  unfinished draft in each tab; repeat with gamepad mode. Disable spectators during a queued
  public message: it must not be delivered. The innkeeper's practice has no multiplayer chat.
- Chat: hide guild names through the gear. Normal, deleted and Bones table headers must follow
  the choice without losing the draft. Tooltips and guild searches must still identify the guild.
  Reload to check persistence, then show the names again. New native chat lines follow the
  choice; previously printed native lines are unchanged. Other players see their own choice.
- The Watch: create a timeout, appeal while a councillor is offline, then overlap online later.
  The subject sees only "a moderator"; authorized staff retain the actor. A preview role grants
  no permissions. Compare current timeout, appeal and decision once, without duplicate rows.
- Wanted: each participant sends their own observed kill/death evidence to a reviewer. Unknown
  identity is not accepted on a claimed guild alone. Publish the reviewed rankings; a trusted
  relay should recover the unchanged signed word for a recipient that already pinned that
  issuer independently. A new recipient without the pin cannot bootstrap from the relay.
- Weekly brief: after the privacy page and update letter, check the five personal lines, close,
  reload, and ensure it stays closed until next reset. No popup in combat, an instance or Busy;
  no sharing setting changes. Public Board summary must not reveal private dues or poll data.
- Lottery: draw Mechanostrider and check its full label above, not across, the result numbers at
  the normal and smaller UI scales. Keep the five-place animation and free tickets.

The in-addon Director checklist is the session record. Mark each item Pass, Fail or Skip with a
short observation, then copy its test report. A skip is not a pass.

## Evidence and promotion

Keep one small table for every candidate:

| Gate | Evidence | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Repository and package | commit, command log, manifest, SHA-256 | Pass / Fail |
| Windows client | client build, screenshots, `/oly bug`, saved log | Pass / Fail / Not run |
| Gamepad, locales and UI | client build and observations | Pass / Fail / Not run |
| Mixed-version session | roster, versions and report | Pass / Fail / Not run |
| Multi-account/adversarial | roster, ledger reconciliation and report | Pass / Fail / Not run |
| Rollback | release restored and restarted | Pass / Fail / Not run |

Do not describe a client or multiplayer gate as passed until somebody observed it. Do not promote
a candidate with an unexplained Lua error, an unintended recipient, a missing recovery path, an
unreconciled balance or a rollback failure.

A [CurseForge Beta file](https://support.curseforge.com/support/solutions/articles/9000197242-file-types-and-additional-fields)
is a public, opt-in distribution. Use it only after the build is safe to publish. Named or closed
testers receive the expiring test zip and its checksum directly; that test zip is not uploaded to
CurseForge or GitHub.
