# Olympus Link: the Worker and D1

The detailed reference for Fernmelder, who runs the Olympus Discord bot on Cloudflare (a Worker
and D1). **Start with [`FERN.md`](FERN.md)**: what to add to your bot, in an afternoon, in your
own Worker's terms. This file explains every part and why each check is there.

The split is yours: your bot keeps `/verify`, does every check and gives the role, and adds one
route, `POST /proof`. The page is ours: a static page on this repository's GitHub Pages
(`web/public/`, at `https://dnl-gentile.github.io/olympus-addon/`) that signs the player in with
Discord, reads the link the game made, and posts it to your `/proof`. Every check lives in
`web/worker/link-core.mjs`, plain functions over D1 that your routes call; `web/worker/link-worker.js`
is a complete Worker built on it. The addon side, the page, the key tool (`scripts/link-keys.py`)
and the watcher's inbox tool (`web/tools/read-inbox.mjs`) come ready. Both files, the D1 schema
and the test vectors are at the end of this one, and `node --test web/test` runs that exact code
against the vectors with a local SQLite in place of D1.

## How it works

A player proves that a World of Warcraft character is theirs by typing, in game, a code the
backend signed for their Discord account. Players who are already trusted (a High Councillor
at launch; later, when you allow it, three randomly drawn verified players) confirm it in game:
their addon signs a confirmation with a key of its own, and says how it checked the player's
guild. The finished, signed proof reaches the Worker in one of two ways, and the Worker gives
the Discord role.

```
 Discord /verify (your bot)
   └─> code  OLC2.<R>.<username>.<exp>.<mode>.<T>.<sig>    (signed with the backend key)

 each confirmer's key is one character's, and so is its certificate:
   every one, a High Councillor's or a drawn player's: you make it, the backend key signs its
   certificate, and the confirmer types both in game (step 8)
   (the council authority, a councillor's addon making its own key and the author's client
    certifying it, is off in the addon, and here while LINK_CA_PUBLIC stays out: step 1b)
 confirmers announce themselves in game with it, from that character only:
   DV~1~OLK2.<keyId>.<public key>.<c|p>.<exp>.<Name-Realm>.<sig>

 in game: the player types  /oly discord <code>, sees "@username", clicks Accept
   requester ──DR (with the tag)──> an online confirmer ──DA──> requester
   (the confirmer's key signs OLY4; the requester checks the signature with the certified key)

 the finished proof (OLB5: each confirmation with its certificate), two ways:
   watcher path:  requester ──DB──> your watcher character (a High Councillor, "watcher on"),
                  whose addon checks every confirmation before it keeps it
                  later, read-inbox.mjs uploads the watcher's SavedVariables ──> POST /api/link/inbox
   can't wait:    the page (GitHub Pages) reads the QR code / the link / Olympus.lua, signs the
                  player in with Discord, and posts both ─────────────────────> POST /proof
                  {"text": <the link>, "discordToken": <the player's Discord sign-in>}

 the Worker checks everything, then your promote() gives the role
```

- The code is the player's alone. Its signature is the secret that ties each link to the
  player who typed it (the tag, below): the QR code and the game's copy box never carry it, so
  a stream that shows the QR code gives nobody a link of their own. `/verify` answers in a
  reply only the player sees, and both it and the page tell players to keep the code, and the
  Olympus Link window, off stream.
- Nothing needs you online: confirmations need only confirmers online. The finished proof
  waits in the player's addon until a watcher is online, then in your watcher's SavedVariables
  until you upload them. One rule for how long, counted from the code's expiry (a code lives a
  day): the Worker takes a link until 7 days after it; the addon hands it to a watcher until 5
  days after it, so you have at least 2 days to upload what your watcher got; the watcher keeps
  it until the Worker would refuse it. Upload the inbox every day or two.
- Nothing is lost when the Worker or Discord is down: the page says so, the addon keeps the
  proof, the code is released again, and either path delivers it later.
- The Worker stores only public keys. The backend's private key is a Worker secret; each
  confirmer's private key stays in that confirmer's game (one character's: another character of
  the same account has its own key, or none); the council authority's private key stays in
  the addon author's own game. Confirmer keys can only confirm.

## What you need

- The Worker you already run, and `wrangler`.
- The bot's Discord application: its client id (Developer Portal, OAuth2), with our page as one
  of its OAuth2 redirects (`https://dnl-gentile.github.io/olympus-addon/`); what your `promote()`
  already uses to give the role (the reference Worker's: the bot token, with Manage Roles and its
  own role above the role it gives, the Olympus server id and the role id); its public key
  (General Information) if `/verify` comes over HTTP.
- Python 3 with the `cryptography` package on the computer where you make keys
  (`python3 -m pip install cryptography`), and Node 18 or newer for the inbox tool (Node 22.13
  or newer to run the tests).

## Setup, step by step

### 1. The backend key

```sh
python3 scripts/link-keys.py backend
```

It prints a seed and a public key, once, and writes nothing to disk.

- The seed goes into the Worker only: `wrangler secret put LINK_BACKEND_SEED`, and paste it.
  Keep a copy in a password manager to recover it; never in a repository, a chat, an issue or a
  screenshot. The Worker imports it into WebCrypto as an Ed25519 JWK (`d` the seed, `x` the
  public key) and checks at the first code that the two belong together.
- The public key (64 hex digits) goes into the Worker var `LINK_BACKEND_PUBLIC`, and to Daniel
  for the addon (`ns.LINK_BACKEND_KEYS` in `Olympus/Link.lua`): the addon refuses any code, and
  any confirmer's certificate, whose signature does not check against one of those keys.
- The same key signs the certificates of the confirmer keys you register (step 8), the High
  Councillors' too. The Worker does it when you register a councillor's key, and a player's once
  it counts. To sign them on your own computer instead (`link-keys.py cert`), keep the seed in a
  file only you can read and give the tool its path; the tool never prints it.
- Rotating it: make a new key, have its public key added to `ns.LINK_BACKEND_KEYS` next to the
  old one (the addon takes two for this), wait until that addon version is out, then switch the
  Worker's `LINK_BACKEND_SEED` and `LINK_BACKEND_PUBLIC`, put the old public key in
  `LINK_BACKEND_PREVIOUS` (the certificates it signed keep counting meanwhile), and renew every
  confirmer's certificate (step 8); once they typed the new lines, remove
  `LINK_BACKEND_PREVIOUS`, before the old key leaves the addon. Codes already handed out stay
  valid until they expire.

### 1b. The council authority (off: leave `LINK_CA_PUBLIC` out)

**Off in this release** (Konig's review of 1.0.0). The addon carries it behind a switch its author
leaves off (`ns.LINK_COUNCIL_AUTHORITY = false` in `Olympus/Link.lua`). While it is off, no
councillor's addon makes a key in game or asks for a certificate, the author's client signs none
(even holding the authority's seed), no addon takes a certificate of the authority, and a key an
earlier build made in game is removed at login, with one line. Why: WoW's Lua has no
cryptographic random source, so a key made in game comes from a few tens of bits of frame timing
(the comment above `Link.EntropySample` in `Olympus/Link.lua` says which), it sits in plain text
in the SavedVariables, and its certificate lasts a year. So every High Councillor's key is one you
make (step 8: kind `c`, with `--bootstrap` at launch), exactly like a player's, and
`LINK_CA_PUBLIC` stays out of your settings (step 5): without it this Worker takes none of the
authority's certificates either. Even with the switch on, the addon runs none of it before the
bot's key is in the addon.

The rest of this section is how the path works, for the day the author turns it on: he tells
you, and you decide then whether to set `LINK_CA_PUBLIC` (and `LINK_COUNCIL_CHARACTERS` with it).

With it on, High Councillors do not type keys. The first time a councillor's addon finds its
character on the signed High Council list, it makes a key of its own, in the game, and keeps it for that
character. When that councillor and the addon's author are online at the same time, the
councillor's addon asks the author's addon for a certificate, and his addon signs one by
itself: for that key, that character, a year. From then on the councillor confirms like anyone with a certificate. The
private key never leaves the councillor's computer, and the key that signs these certificates
(the council authority's) never leaves the author's.

The author makes the authority once, on his computer:

```sh
python3 scripts/link-keys.py ca
```

It writes `dist/LinkCA.lua` (the seed, which only the author's own game loads, and which is never
printed, published or committed) and prints a public key. That public key goes into:

- the Worker var `LINK_CA_PUBLIC` (step 5), so this Worker takes those certificates;
- the addon (`ns.LINK_CA_KEYS` in `Olympus/Link.lua`), so every player's addon does too.

What the Worker does with them, in plain words:

- A councillor's key certified this way is never registered with you. Every confirmation in a
  link carries its certificate, so the Worker checks it there: signed by the council authority,
  a councillor's (tier `c`), its id the first 12 hex digits of the SHA-256 of the key itself, still
  valid when the confirmation was signed. It then counts like a registered councillor key.
- The first time a link it confirmed is accepted, the Worker writes down whose it is: the key
  itself (its public key), its id and the councillor's character (the `council_keys` table). It
  writes this with the link, after checking the confirmation's signature and everything else, and
  never for a link it refuses: a certificate for someone else's key, carried with a signature
  nobody made, leaves no trace. From then on, the same key with a certificate naming another
  character is refused. (The author's client never certifies one key for two characters either:
  it keeps a record of every key it certified.)
- What that trusts: whoever holds the authority's seed (the author's game, or anyone who copied
  `dist/LinkCA.lua` from it) can certify a key for any character, and one councillor's
  confirmation links. `LINK_COUNCIL_CHARACTERS` (step 5) keeps that with you: the High
  Councillors' characters you accept (`Name-Realm`, comma-separated). A certificate for any
  other character counts for nothing, whatever the authority signs. Closed by default: left out
  or empty, no certificate of the authority counts. The authority can still certify a new key
  for a character on the list (that is how `/oly discord key new` works), so watch
  `council_keys` (every such key, with `first_seen`) and `used` (the keys that counted for each
  code). Keys you register yourself are not affected by the list, and leaving `LINK_CA_PUBLIC`
  out makes them the only councillor keys.
- A key the councillor no longer uses keeps counting here until you revoke it: this Worker never
  asks the councillor's game, and a certificate lasts a year. Whoever holds that key (a leaked
  one, or the councillor after leaving) could still make links with it outside the game. So:
- Revoking one key (it leaked, or the councillor replaced it): send
  `{"key_id": "<the 12 hex digits>", "revoke": true}` to `/api/link/keys` (or run the SQL of
  `python3 scripts/link-keys.py revoke <id>`). It goes on the revocation list (`revoked_keys`) at
  once, whether a link used it already or not, and its confirmations stop counting. `/oly discord
  status` in the councillor's game shows the current key's id; `/oly discord key new` (a new key,
  whose certificate comes from the author's client the next time they meet) and `/oly discord key
  off` print the old key's id for them to send you, and say it counts until you revoke it.
- Revoking a councillor (the author took them off the signed list, or you can't name all their
  keys): send `{"character": "<Name-Realm>", "revoke": true}` (or run the SQL of `python3
  scripts/link-keys.py revoke --character <Name-Realm>`). Every certificate the council authority
  signed for that character until now stops counting, whatever key it names, seen here or not
  (keys they rotated away included), and so do the keys you registered for that character. The
  answer lists those keys, and the authority's keys seen for that character. A certificate the
  authority signs for it afterwards counts (a councillor back on the list, whose addon makes a new
  key with `/oly discord key new` after you revoked) only while the character is on
  `LINK_COUNCIL_CHARACTERS`: taking it off the list is how you keep one out for good. So revoke
  only the old key's id when a councillor just rotated a leaked key: revoking the character
  would stop the new one too, until another `key new`.
- Taking a councillor off the signed list stops them in game at once: their addon stops
  confirming, and nobody's addon asks them or keeps a link that counts on them. It does not stop
  them here (this Worker never sees the signed list): revoke the character too.
- What the council authority signed: in the author's game, `/oly discord certified` prints every
  certificate his client signed (the key id, the character, the end), which his SavedVariables
  keep (`OlympusDB.discord.certified`). He sends you that list when a councillor leaves or a key
  leaks, and you revoke by key id or by character.
- One councillor's key never confirms codes of their own Discord account or its characters, once
  their character is linked (the Worker looks it up in `members`).

You can still register a councillor's key yourself (step 8, `--bootstrap`) for a councillor who
wants one made on a computer: both kinds work side by side.

### 2. The database

```sh
wrangler d1 create olympus-link
wrangler d1 execute olympus-link --remote --file web/worker/schema.sql
```

A database of its own, bound as `LINK_DB` (step 5): the tables have plain names (`codes`, `keys`,
`members`...) that could meet yours. `link-core.mjs` reads `LINK_DB`, or `DB` when there is no
`LINK_DB`. Nine tables: `codes` (every code issued, single use, with its draw threshold), `keys`
(confirmer public keys you registered, one certified per Discord account, each for one
character, with the end of their certificate), `council_keys` (High Councillors' keys the council
authority certified, recorded with the first link each one helped accept), `revoked_keys` (the council
authority's keys you revoked, and the ids of keys forgotten with their owner), `revoked_characters` (characters whose keys you revoked all at
once), `used` (the proofs that counted), `members` (linked characters,
with how their guild was checked), `inbox_uploads` (every bundle received: the audit trail and
the page's limit per account) and `limits` (the page's limits before Discord is asked: keyed
hashes of IP addresses and sign-ins, counted; and each account's codes a day and links an hour,
under a keyed hash of its Discord id, which a forget leaves). The full schema is in "The D1
schema" below. Run the same command again after an update of `schema.sql`: it only adds what is
missing.

### 3. The code

Copy `web/worker/link-core.mjs` next to your Worker's entry file. It needs nothing but WebCrypto
(Ed25519 and SHA-256), `fetch` and D1: no npm packages. Your routes call it:

```js
import { handleProof, handleInbox, handleKeys, pruneLink } from './link-core.mjs';

export default {
	async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
		const { pathname } = new URL(request.url);
		const roles = { promote: (id) => promote(env, id), demote: (id) => demote(env, id) }; // yours
		if (pathname === '/proof') return handleProof(request, env, roles);
		if (pathname === '/api/link/inbox') return handleInbox(request, env, roles);
		if (pathname === '/api/link/keys') return handleKeys(request, env);
		return yourBot(request, env, ctx); // everything you already answer, /verify included (step 7)
	},
	async scheduled(event, env, ctx) {
		ctx.waitUntil(pruneLink(env)); // once a day: [triggers] crons in wrangler.toml (step 5)
	},
};
```

- `promote(discordId, verdict)` is yours: it gives the role. Resolve when it did; throw (or
  return `false`) when Discord refused, and the code is freed so the same link works on the next
  try; `{ ok: false, reason: 'not-in-server' }` tells the player to join the server first. A
  link never moves a character linked to one Discord account to another, nor takes anyone's
  role (`linked-elsewhere`, "What the Worker checks"). `demote(discordId)` takes the role when
  the player deletes his own link on the page ("The API"); give it, or take the role yourself.
- `acceptProof(env, text, { discordId, promote })` is the whole link, for routes you write
  yourself: the checks ("What the Worker checks"), then it claims the code, records the
  character, and only then calls `promote` (taking the record back if it fails).
  `checkProof(env, text, { discordId })` gives the same verdict, reading only. `handleProof` is
  `acceptProof` with the page's CORS, the sign-in check, the rate limit and
  the audit trail around it, and the player's own "Delete my link" (`forgetOwnLink`).
- `pruneLink(env)`, once a day from your `scheduled()` (Konig's review: nothing was pruned),
  deletes what no link can use any more: codes past their delivery grace (7 days after they
  expire), the proofs recorded for codes gone that link nothing now (what counted for a
  character still linked stays), the audit trail's lines older than `LINK.LOG_DAYS` (90) and the
  limits whose window ended. Keys, links, the council authority's keys seen and the
  revocation lists stay. It answers how many rows went from each.
- `web/worker/link-worker.js` is a complete Worker on the same functions (its `discordRole` is a
  `promote`), with its routes under `/api/link/` and its `scheduled()`.

### 4. Who is sending

The page is on another origin (GitHub Pages) and has no cookie of yours. It sends the player's
Discord sign-in in the body, and `handleProof` asks Discord who that is (`discordUser`):

- The page signs the player in on Discord's own page (OAuth2, the implicit grant, scope
  `identify`, your application's client id, a random `state` it checks when Discord comes back),
  keeps the access token in that browser tab only, and sends it as `discordToken`, with the link
  as `text`.
- The Worker asks `GET https://discord.com/api/v10/oauth2/@me` with it: the token must be your
  application's (`application.id` is `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID`), with `identify`, and not expired. A token
  another site got for its own application counts for nothing. The token goes to Discord only and
  is stored nowhere. Its user is the account that must own the link's code (`other-user` if not).
- Before it asks Discord anything, it counts (`tooManyRequests`, Konig's review): Discord blocks
  for a while an address that sends it too many bad tokens, and that address is your Worker's.
  20 a minute per IP address (Cloudflare's `CF-Connecting-IP`), 10 an hour per sign-in, 300 a
  minute for the whole page (`LINK.IP_PER_MINUTE`, `SIGNIN_PER_HOUR`, `PAGE_PER_MINUTE`), in that
  order, so an address over its limit spends nothing of the others; past one, `429 limit` and
  Discord is not asked. An IPv4 address counts as itself (`::ffff:a.b.c.d` too) and an IPv6
  address by its /64: one host is routinely given a whole /64, and counting each of its addresses
  apart would let it fill the page's 300 a minute alone and shut everyone else out (Konig's
  review). Once the whole page is at its limit, a request is refused before anything is counted,
  so a flood past it adds no rows. The `limits` table holds a keyed hash (HMAC-SHA-256 with the
  backend seed) of each address (or /64) and sign-in, never either one.
- CORS: only `LINK_ORIGIN` (`https://dnl-gentile.github.io`, exactly: never `*`, and no
  credentials) gets `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`. `OPTIONS` (the browser's preflight) answers 204
  for it and 403 for anyone else, and a `POST` from another origin, or with none, is refused
  (`origin`).
- `LINK_SITE_TOKEN`, when you set it: the page sends it as `Authorization: Bearer <it>`. It sits in
  the page's `config.js` for anyone to read: a switch that cuts the page off the moment you change
  it, not a secret.
- `username` in a code is the Discord username (the unique, lowercase handle), not the display
  name: it is what the player sees in the game's Accept window.
- Same-site variant: a page served from your own site, behind your own login, can use the
  reference Worker's `/api/link/me`, `/api/link/code` and `/api/link/submit` instead, with
  `sessionUser` (its `ADAPT` function) connected to that login. The GitHub Pages page never uses
  them.

### 5. Settings

```toml
# wrangler.toml (your existing file: add these)
[triggers]
crons = ["17 4 * * *"]                   # pruneLink, daily (step 3)

[[d1_databases]]
binding = "LINK_DB"
database_name = "olympus-link"
database_id = "<from wrangler d1 create>"

[vars]
LINK_MODE = "c"                          # councillors only at launch; "a" when the pool is large enough
LINK_GUILD_POLICY = "verified"           # or "claimed": see "The guild check" below
LINK_ORIGIN = "https://dnl-gentile.github.io"         # the page's origin: no path, no trailing slash
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID = "<your application's client id>"  # the page's sign-in must be for it
LINK_BACKEND_PUBLIC = "<64 hex from link-keys.py backend>"
# LINK_BACKEND_PREVIOUS = "<the old 64 hex>"   # only while you rotate the backend key (step 1)
# The council authority is off (step 1b): leave these two out.
# LINK_CA_PUBLIC = "a84125fa433276244fda242a28d2e4208a5d6db26dcb529e3e87af61939e10a7"
# LINK_COUNCIL_CHARACTERS = "<Name-Realm>, <Name-Realm>"  # with it: the High Councillors you accept (none when left out)
DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY = "<Developer Portal > General Information > Public Key>"      # only for /verify over HTTP
```

```sh
wrangler secret put LINK_BACKEND_SEED    # from link-keys.py backend
wrangler secret put LINK_ADMIN_TOKEN     # python3 -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"
wrangler secret put LINK_SITE_TOKEN      # optional (step 4)
```

`LINK_ADMIN_TOKEN` (at least 32 characters) is for your own tools only: the watcher inbox
upload and the confirmer keys (`/api/link/keys`), and in the reference Worker a gateway bot's
code requests. The reference Worker's own role also reads `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`, `GUILD_ID` and
`ROLE_ID`.

### 6. The page

The page is ours, on this repository's GitHub Pages: `https://dnl-gentile.github.io/olympus-addon/`,
published from `web/public/` by `.github/workflows/pages.yml`. It is plain HTML, CSS and ES modules,
no build step, and every address in it is relative. Its settings are one file,
`web/public/config.js`: your `/proof` address (`PROOF_URL`), your application's client id
(`DISCORD_CLIENT_ID`), the site token if you gave one (`SITE_TOKEN`), and the command that gives a
code (`VERIFY_COMMAND`, `/verify`). Until those are filled in, it says Olympus Link is not open yet.

The page's address is what the addon puts in the QR code (`ns.LINK_SITE`, followed by `#b=` and
the signed link). The part after `#` never reaches a server: a phone that scans the QR code opens
the page, which reads the link from its own address, asks the player to sign in with Discord if
needed, and sends it. Its one request is `POST <PROOF_URL>` with `{"text", "discordToken"}` (no
cookie, no referrer); it loads nothing but its own files and Google Fonts (its
Content-Security-Policy says so, and its `connect-src` names your Worker's origin once `PROOF_URL`
is set), and it shows nothing to click inside another page's frame.

The code step tells the player to use `/verify` in the Olympus server and to keep the code, and
the game's Olympus Link window, off stream and out of screenshots. `?demo=code` (and `wait`,
`screen`, `scanning`, `phone`, `other`, `pick`, `scanned`, `found`, `done`, `error`, `forget`,
`forgotten`, `closed`) shows
each step with made-up data and never calls anything; `&lang=pt` shows the Portuguese page (it is
chosen from the browser's language otherwise).

Tell Daniel the name of your watcher's owner for the game's texts ("Fernmelder's watcher",
`ns.LINK_WATCHER_OWNER`).

### 7. `/verify` in Discord

A player types `/verify` in the Olympus server and gets their code in a reply only they see (it
also tells them to keep it off stream):

```js
const code = await issueCode(env, { id: user.id, username: user.username }); // the member's Discord user
// code.reply: the line to paste in the game, or why there is none (3 codes a day; an old-style username)
```

- **Over HTTP** (the application's Interactions Endpoint URL): answer
  `{ type: 4, data: { flags: 64, content: code.reply } }` (64: only they see it). The reference
  Worker's `/api/discord/interactions` checks Discord's signature on every request with
  `DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY` and answers `/verify` itself. Do not point the endpoint there if your bot
  receives its commands over the gateway: Discord sends them to one place only.
- **Over the gateway** (discord.js, discord.py...): the bot asks the Worker and replies (the
  reference Worker's `/api/link/bot-code` runs `issueCode`):

```js
// discord.js v14
client.on('interactionCreate', async (interaction) => {
	if (!interaction.isChatInputCommand() || interaction.commandName !== 'verify') return;
	const res = await fetch('https://<your worker>/api/link/bot-code', {
		method: 'POST',
		headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.LINK_ADMIN_TOKEN}`, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
		body: JSON.stringify({ id: interaction.user.id, username: interaction.user.username }),
	});
	const data = await res.json();
	await interaction.reply({ content: data.reply || data.message, flags: 64 }); // 64: only they see it
});
```

If `/verify` is new, register it once (a `POST` adds or updates this one command and leaves your
others):

```sh
curl -X POST "https://discord.com/api/v10/applications/$APP_ID/guilds/$GUILD_ID/commands" \
  -H "Authorization: Bot $DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"verify","description":"Get your Olympus Link code for the game","type":1}'
```

### 8. Confirmer keys

Each confirmer you register has a key of their own, made on your computer, for one of their
characters, and a certificate for it signed with the backend key that names that character. The
confirmer types two lines in game, on that character: the key, then the certificate. That is every
confirmer, the High Councillors included: their addons make no key of their own (step 1b). The
addon keeps neither line until the release that carries your bot's key (`ns.LINK_BACKEND_KEYS`).

```sh
python3 scripts/link-keys.py confirmer <id> c --character "<Name-Realm>" --owner <their Discord id> --username <their username> --bootstrap
python3 scripts/link-keys.py confirmer <id> p --character "<Name-Realm>" --owner <their Discord id> --username <their username>
```

- `<id>`: 6 to 16 of a-z and 0-9, never reused (it is part of what they sign); 12 hex digits are
  kept for the council authority's keys.
- `--character`: the one character that confirms with this key, as the game writes it
  (`Name-Realm`). Only that character's addon announces the key and signs with it; players'
  addons ask it only from that character, and the Worker counts a confirmation only when its
  certificate is the one registered for the key, signed by the backend key, and names the
  confirming character. An alt of
  the same account needs its own key (or confirms nothing).
- `c` is a High Councillor, `p` a player for the draw (mode `a`). The character must be one of the
  key owner's linked characters (the Worker refuses the key otherwise, `character-not-linked`,
  and checks it again for every confirmation); `--bootstrap` lifts that for the first councillor
  keys, since at launch nobody has linked a character yet.
- The tool prints the line the confirmer types in game (`/oly discord key <id> <seed>`), which
  you send them privately (a direct message, never a channel); the public key; and two ways to
  register it:
  - **With the Worker** (the backend seed stays in the Worker): the tool prints the `curl`
    that posts the key to `POST /api/link/keys` with your admin token. For a councillor key,
    the answer's `command` is the second line for the confirmer: `/oly discord cert
    <certificate>`. For a player key, the answer's `cert_from` says when to ask for it (below).
  - **In D1 directly**: the `INSERT` it prints, then the certificate with
    `python3 scripts/link-keys.py cert <id> <public key> <c|p> <days> --character "<Name-Realm>" --backend-seed-file <file>`
    (or `LINK_BACKEND_SEED_FILE` / `LINK_BACKEND_SEED` in the environment), which prints the
    `/oly discord cert` line and the `UPDATE` that records the certificate's end in D1. A player
    key's also takes `--created <its created> --owner <its owner_discord_id>`: `confirmer`
    prints that command, filled in. Given the backend seed the same way, `confirmer` prints a
    councillor key's certificate at once.
- In game, `/oly discord key` shows the id and the public key, to compare with yours; the addon
  checks that the certificate names the public half of the key typed before it, and this
  character. It never prints, sends or logs the seed. Both lines fit the game's chat (under 255
  characters), and so does the announcement that carries the certificate (`DV~1~<certificate>`).
- **A player key gets its certificate only once it counts.** Every player's addon asks the
  player keys with a valid certificate that a code's `T` draws, and cannot tell how old a key
  is. The Worker counts a player key only for codes issued once it was 7 days old and its
  owner's Discord account 30 days old, and a code stays open for a day. So a player key is
  certified only when it counts for every code still open: 8 days and 5 minutes after you
  registered it at the soonest (7 days, a day for the codes already handed out, 5 minutes of
  clock difference), and 31 days and 5 minutes after the owner's Discord account was made when
  that is later. Until then it is not in the draw, and nobody asks it. `cert_from` in the
  Worker's answer is that time: from then on, `{"key_id": "<id>", "renew": true}` answers the
  certificate line (before, `too-early` with `cert_from`), and you send the confirmer both lines
  together. `link-keys.py cert` refuses a player certificate before that time too. A
  councillor's key is certified at once: councillors count without the draw.
- The certificate is how every player's addon knows, without the bot, that a confirmer's key
  is registered and whether it is a councillor's: it asks only confirmers with a valid,
  unexpired certificate (a `c` one only from a councillor of the signed list), and checks each
  confirmation's signature with the certified key before it counts it. It lasts 365 days for a
  councillor and 90 for a player by default (`days` in the request, `--days` for the tool):
  renew it before it ends (`{"key_id": "<id>", "renew": true}`, or `link-keys.py cert` again),
  and the confirmer types the new `/oly discord cert` line. A key whose certificate has ended
  leaves the draw, and what it signs after that end counts for nothing (the end of the
  certificate the proof carries, and of the latest one D1 recorded: a key D1 holds no
  certificate for counts for nothing either). A player's is shorter because the addons cannot learn that you revoked a
  key or replaced it: they keep asking it, when the draw picks it, until its certificate ends,
  and the Worker refuses what it signs. A replaced or revoked key gets no new certificate.
- One certified key per Discord account: the database refuses a second. **Rotating** (a new key
  for the same person): register the new one with `"replace": true`. Its first certificate
  replaces the old key: a councillor's at once; a player's once it counts (above), so until
  then the old key keeps counting, and the confirmer keeps using it. In D1, run the `UPDATE ...
  replaced_at` that `link-keys.py cert` prints before its `UPDATE ... cert_exp` (for a
  councillor key certified at once, the one `confirmer` prints before its `INSERT`). A
  replaced key leaves the draw (a player key no longer counts for codes issued after that) but
  still checks the confirmations it signed, so links waiting for the watcher keep counting.
  Send the confirmer the new lines as soon as you have the certificate: while their addon still
  announces the old player key, requesters may ask it in vain. Once they typed the new lines in
  game, revoke the old key. In that order: rotate the key in game first, then revoke.
  **Revoking**: `{"key_id": "<id>", "revoke": true}`, or `python3 scripts/link-keys.py revoke
  <id>`, and the confirmer types `/oly discord key off` (every key of one character at once:
  `{"character": "<Name-Realm>", "revoke": true}`, step 1b). A revoked key's confirmations stop
  counting at once, including ones not delivered yet: a leaked key is revoked at once, without
  waiting. A link carries up to two councillor confirmations, so one revoked councillor key
  does not sink it; the Worker counts any three valid player confirmations of the up to four a
  link carries. `python3 scripts/link-keys.py public < seed.txt` prints the public key of a seed.
- Keys only confirm: they cannot issue codes, a player key cannot link anyone alone, and the
  addon signs on its own only within its limits (one proof a minute and 5 a day per requesting
  character, 30 a minute in all, never for its own account's characters, never across
  factions, only for Olympus guilds).

### 9. Your watcher

On one of your High Councillor characters, type `/oly discord watcher on`. While it is online,
players whose proof is ready deliver it to it, and it keeps them in its SavedVariables
(`OlympusDB.discord.inbox`, 500 at most). Its addon first checks every confirmation of a link
with the certificate the link carries (and that together they are enough), so made-up links never
take a place. It keeps one link per character (its latest) and no cap per code: a code's `R` is
public on a stream and only this Worker can check the tag, so a character that got a councillor's
real confirmation for itself with someone's `R` takes its own place (you will see it refused as
`tag`), never the real requester's. An entry stays until the Worker can no longer take it (7 days
after its code expired). WoW writes that file on `/reload`, logout or quit. Then, every day or two:

```sh
# macOS
LINK_ADMIN_TOKEN=... node web/tools/read-inbox.mjs "/Applications/World of Warcraft/_classic_beta_/WTF/Account/<ACCOUNT>/SavedVariables/Olympus.lua" --post https://<your worker>/api/link/inbox
# Windows (PowerShell)
$env:LINK_ADMIN_TOKEN="..."; node web/tools/read-inbox.mjs "C:\Program Files (x86)\World of Warcraft\_classic_beta_\WTF\Account\<ACCOUNT>\SavedVariables\Olympus.lua" --post https://<your worker>/api/link/inbox
```

Without `--post` it prints the same JSON (`{"bundles": [...]}`, oldest first) for you to look
at or send another way. It reads the file with a small SavedVariables parser (no packages),
takes every inbox entry however the addon keys it (by code, or by code and sender), sends each
link once, skips malformed entries, and prints the inbox only: never the confirmer key kept in
the same file. Uploading twice is harmless: a link that already counted answers `already`. It
only posts over `https` (or to `localhost`), since the admin token rides along.

### 10. From councillors only to drawn players

Launch with `LINK_MODE = "c"`: only councillor confirmations count, and every code says so (the
addon then asks councillors only). When enough verified players have keys, set it to `"a"`:
new codes also accept three drawn players when no councillor is online, and each carries the
draw's threshold `T`, so the addon asks the players this Worker's draw picks. Since a player
key is certified only once the Worker counts it (step 8), every certified key a code draws
counts, but for one you revoked or replaced while its certificate runs: the addons cannot learn
that, may still ask it, and the Worker refuses what it signs, so a link then needs three other
drawn players, or a councillor. Codes already issued keep the mode and `T` they were signed
with. Register the first player keys at least 8 days before you switch: a player key gets its
certificate only then (step 8), and until some have one, only councillors confirm.

The rule is three of the M keys drawn for each code (M = max(20, 3% of the pool), "The
formats"), not three of five: the addon asks five at a time, but the Worker takes any three drawn
keys. While there are 20 player keys or fewer, every key is drawn for every code, so any three
key holders from three accounts could confirm anyone: give the first player keys only to people
you trust that far, or wait until the pool is large. `drawLimit` in `link-core.mjs` sets M (the
addon follows the `T` each code carries).

## The guild check

Each confirmation says how the confirmer checked the guild the player claims, and signs it:

- `r`: the claimed guild is the confirmer's own guild, and its roster, read by the confirmer's
  addon, lists the player;
- `w`: the confirmer's game ran a `/who` less than 15 minutes ago that showed the player in
  exactly that guild;
- `c`: claimed only. The confirmer still checked that it is an Olympus guild of its own
  faction, but could not see the player in it.

The player's addon keeps asking other confirmers (within their limits) to get at least one `r`
or `w`, and carries up to four confirmations. `LINK_GUILD_POLICY` says what the Worker needs:

- `"verified"` (the default): at least one confirmation that counts (a councillor's, or a drawn
  player's in mode `a`) checked the guild (`r` or `w`). At launch only councillors confirm, so
  in practice this links the members of the councillors' own guild (Olympus I), found in its
  roster, and anyone a councillor saw in a `/who` in the last 15 minutes. A player of another
  Olympus guild who was not seen is told to type the code again while a councillor is around
  (answer `guild-unverified`: the code stays unused).
- `"claimed"`: any valid confirmation. The character is still proved to be the player's (that
  is what the confirmations sign), but the guild on the role is taken as the player named it.
  More players get through at launch; fewer guarantees about the guild.

Either way, `members.gv` records how the guild was checked (`r`, `w` or `c`), so you can tell
the two apart later or switch the policy without losing track.

## The API

All JSON. The page's call carries the player's Discord sign-in in its body (and your site token,
if any, in `Authorization`); the tools' carry the admin token. The paths are the reference
Worker's: in your own Worker they are wherever your routes put them (the page takes `/proof`'s
whole address in `config.js`).

| Route | Who | Body | Answer |
|---|---|---|---|
| `POST /proof` (`handleProof`; the reference Worker's `/api/link/proof`) | the page, from `LINK_ORIGIN` | `{"text": "OLB5~... or its address", "discordToken": "<access token>"}`, or `{"forget": true, "discordToken"}` (the player's own "Delete my link": `200 {"status": "forgotten", "characters"}`) | `200 {"status", "reason", "message", "R", "username", "character", "guild", "faction", "guildCheck", "guildKnown", "characters"}`; `401 {"reason": "login" \| "site"}`, `403 {"reason": "origin"}`, `400 {"reason": "format"}` (no text or token), `429 {"reason": "limit"}` past the limits before Discord is asked (20 a minute per IP address, an IPv6 one by its /64, 10 an hour per sign-in, 300 a minute in all) or after 10 links an hour per account; `OPTIONS`: `204` with the CORS headers for `LINK_ORIGIN` only |
| `POST /api/link/inbox` (`handleInbox`) | watcher tool | `{"bundles": [{"R", "bundle", "from", "t"}]}` (500 at most) | `200 {"results": [{"R", "status", "reason", "message"}]}` |
| `POST /api/link/keys` (`handleKeys`) | you | `{"key_id", "public_key", "owner_discord_id", "owner_username", "character", "kind", "bootstrap", "days", "replace"}`, or `{"key_id", "renew": true, "days"}`, or `{"key_id", "revoke": true}`, or `{"character", "revoke": true}` | `200 {"status": "ok", "key_id", "kind", "character", "public_key", "cert", "cert_exp", "cert_from", "command", "replaced"}`: a new player key's `cert`, `cert_exp` and `command` are `null` (with a `message`) until `cert_from`, when `renew` gives them (`{"status": "ok", "revoked": true}` for a revoke, with `"council": true` and the councillor's `character`, once seen, for a key of the council authority's; `{"status": "ok", "character", "revoked": true, "keys", "council_keys"}` for a character: the registered keys it revoked, the authority's keys seen for it); `409 {"reason": "key-id-used" \| "public-key-used" \| "owner-has-key" \| "character-not-linked" \| "revoked" \| "replaced" \| "too-early"}` (`too-early` with `cert_from`), `404 {"reason": "unknown-key"}`, `400 {"reason": "format"}` |
| `POST /api/link/bot-code` | gateway bot | `{"id", "username"}` | `200 {"token", "command", "exp", "mode", "reply"}` |
| `POST /api/discord/interactions` | Discord | an interaction | `PING`, or `/verify` answered ephemerally |
| `GET /api/link/me`, `POST /api/link/code`, `POST /api/link/submit` | a same-site page only (step 4) | as `/proof`, with your login's cookie and `{"bundle"}` | the same answers |

`status` is `linked` (reason `linked`, or `already` when that link had already counted),
`rejected` (reason `format`, `unknown-code`, `other-user`, `tag`, `code-used`, `expired`,
`not-enough`, `guild-unverified`, `linked-elsewhere`, `not-in-server`: the code stays unused),
`forgotten` (reason `forgotten`: the player deleted his own link, below) or `error` (`login`,
`origin`, `site`, `limit`, `discord`, `server`: nothing was used, try again).

**The player deletes his own link** (Konig's review: players could not): the page's "Delete my
link", at the foot of every step, signs the player in with Discord and sends the same route
`{"forget": true, "discordToken": "<access token>"}`. `handleProof` checks it as it checks a link
(origin, site token, the limits before Discord, the sign-in with Discord), then `forgetOwnLink`:
your `demote(discordId)` takes the role (an answer `{ ok: false, reason: 'not-in-server' }` is
fine: there is none to take; any other failure deletes nothing and answers `discord`, to try
again), then `forgetUser` deletes everything kept about the account but its limits (its codes
today and links this hour, counted under a keyed hash of its Discord id until their window ends,
so a delete never gives more: Konig's review). The answer: `200 {"status":
"forgotten", "reason": "forgotten", "message", "username", "characters"}` (the characters no
longer linked). Without `demote`, only the data goes: take the role yourself. `PROOF_REASONS` in
`link-core.mjs` lists them, and the page shows each one in English or Portuguese with what to do
next.

The page's request lives in `web/public/backend.js` (`proofRequest`), its settings in
`web/public/config.js`.

## The formats

- **Code token** (the backend signs it, the player pastes it):
  `OLC2.<R>.<username>.<exp>.<mode>.<T>.<sig>`. `R`: 10 characters of Crockford base32
  (`0123456789ABCDEFGHJKMNPQRSTVWXYZ`) from `crypto.getRandomValues`, single use. `username`:
  the Discord username, `[a-z0-9_.]{2,32}` (it may hold dots: read the token from both ends).
  `exp`: unix time, 24 hours after issue. `mode`: `c` or `a`. `T`: the draw's threshold, 8
  lowercase hex (below), `00000000` in mode `c`. `sig`: base64url without padding (86
  characters) of the backend's Ed25519 signature over the ASCII bytes
  `OLC2.<R>.<username>.<exp>.<mode>.<T>`. `/oly discord <token>` is 172 bytes at most, within
  the game's 255. The addon also takes it after `/oly discord` or `/olympus discord` pasted
  into its code box.
- **The draw**: a player key's prefix for code `R` is the first 8 hex of
  `SHA-256(R + "~" + keyId)`. When it issues a code in mode `a`, the Worker sorts the prefixes of
  the active player keys (not revoked or replaced, a certificate that has not ended, 7 days old,
  and a Discord account 30 days old) and signs `T`: the prefix at index M, counting from 0, with
  M = max(20, ceil(3% of those keys)), or `ffffffff` when there are M keys or fewer. A key is
  drawn for `R` when its prefix is below `T` (compared as text): the M lowest. The addon asks
  only drawn, online, certified player keys, lowest first, five at once; the Worker certifies a
  player key only once it counts for every open code (step 8).
- **Key certificate**: `OLK2.<keyId>.<public key>.<tier>.<exp>.<Name-Realm>.<sig>`. The public
  key in base64url (43 characters), `tier` `c` or `p`, `exp` unix time, `Name-Realm` the one
  character that confirms with the key (it may hold dots: read the certificate from both ends),
  `sig` an Ed25519 signature over the UTF-8 bytes of everything before the last dot: the
  backend's (a key you registered: the confirmer types it), or, for a High Councillor's key
  (tier `c`) whose id is the first 12 hex of SHA-256 of its 32 bytes, the council authority's
  (the author's addon whispers it to the councillor's; only with that path on, off as the addon
  ships: step 1b). At most 240 bytes: the confirmer's addon announces it as
  `DV~1~<certificate>`, and only from that character.
- **Tag**: the first 16 lowercase hex of `SHA-256(<the code token's sig> + "~" + <requester>)`,
  the requester as `Name-Realm`. The requester's addon makes it from the command it was given
  and sends it with its request; the Worker makes it again from the token it stored.
- **Confirmation** (a confirmer's addon signs it, UTF-8):
  `OLY4~<requester>~<guild>~<gv>~<faction>~<nonce>~<R>~<tag>~<issued>~<keyId>~<confirmer>`.
  Names are `Name-Realm` as the game writes them (the requester as the game server stamped its
  whisper, the confirmer itself); guild at most 40 bytes, an Olympus guild; `gv` `r`, `w` or
  `c` ("The guild check"); faction `Alliance` or `Horde`, the confirmer's own; nonce 16
  lowercase hex digits; issued the confirmer's server time.
- **Bundle**: `OLB5~<requester>~<guild>~<faction>~<nonce>~<R>~<tag>~<p1>;<p2>;...`, each proof
  `<issued>,<keyId>,<confirmer>,<gv>,<sig>,<public key>,<tier>,<cert exp>,<cert sig>`: the last
  four are its key's certificate, `OLK2.<keyId>.<public key>.<tier>.<cert exp>.<confirmer>.<cert
  sig>`, so a watcher and this Worker check it without having heard it. 1 to 4 proofs, 2400 bytes
  at most. A field holds no `~`, `;`, `,`, `|` or control character; a name is at most 64 bytes
  and its realm (after the last dash) has no dash or space.
- **Link** (the QR code and the game's copy box): `<the page's address>#b=<bundle,
  percent-encoded>`. It never holds the token.

## What the Worker checks

For every bundle, from the page or the inbox (`checkProof` reads, `acceptProof` then links):

1. It is well formed (the rules above; the page and the addon read exactly the same).
2. The code `R` exists. From the page, it belongs to the account the player's Discord sign-in
   names (checked with Discord, step 4; else `other-user`); from the inbox, the
   account is the code's owner. The tag is the one made from that code's own token and the
   bundle's requester (else `tag`: whoever saw `R` in a QR code cannot use it for another
   character). The code is unused (a link that already counted answers `already`). The
   character is not linked to another Discord account (else `linked-elsewhere`, and the code
   stays unused): a link never moves a character from one account to another, so neither one
   councillor's proof nor a leaked councillor key takes a member's link or role. Its owner removes
   the link first, or you do (`forgetUser`, or its row in `members`); the same account linking
   its own character again, with a new code, updates it.
3. Its confirmations were signed within the code's life (from issue, less 5 minutes of clock
   difference, to `exp`), none more than 5 minutes ahead of the Worker's clock (the requester's
   addon refuses the same). The bundle may arrive up to 7 days after `exp`: the addon hands it to
   a watcher until 5 days after `exp`, which leaves the watcher's keeper 2 days to upload it;
   after that it is `expired`.
4. For each proof, its key: a key registered here, not revoked, whose certificate (the one the
   proof carries) names its public key, its tier and the confirming character as registered, is
   signed by the backend key (`LINK_BACKEND_PUBLIC`, or `LINK_BACKEND_PREVIOUS` while it
   changes) and still ran when the proof was signed, as did the latest certificate D1 recorded
   for the key (`cert_exp`; a key that never got one counts for nothing); or (only with
   `LINK_CA_PUBLIC` set, step 1b) a High Councillor's key the council authority certified (the
   certificate checks with `LINK_CA_PUBLIC`, tier `c`, the id the key's hash, valid when the
   proof was signed), for a character on `LINK_COUNCIL_CHARACTERS` (none when that list is left
   out), not on the revocation list, not signed (its end less a year) at or before a revocation
   of its character, and not recorded for another character. Then: its owner is not the code's account;
   the Worker rebuilds the exact `OLY4` text and verifies the Ed25519 signature with the key
   (WebCrypto: a non-canonical signature fails); the confirmer is one of the key owner's linked
   characters (except bootstrap and council authority keys: their certificate names the
   character); the requester is neither the confirmer nor one of the key owner's characters; and
   (R, keyId) never counted before.
5. It accepts with **one valid councillor proof**. In mode `a` it also accepts **three valid
   player proofs** from three different owners, none the requester, signed within 5 minutes of
   each other, each key drawn for this code (its prefix below the `T` stored with the code),
   and, when the code was issued, each key at least 7 days old, not yet replaced, and each
   owner's Discord account at least 30 days old (read from the Discord id).
6. With `LINK_GUILD_POLICY = "verified"`, one of the proofs that count (a councillor's, or a
   drawn player's in mode `a`) checked the guild (`r` or `w`), else `guild-unverified`.
7. Then it claims the code (so two deliveries cannot both count), records the character in
   `members`, with the proofs that counted (`used`) and the council authority's keys whose proofs
   checked (`council_keys`), and only then calls your `promote()` to give the role: nothing is
   written for a proof before the whole link is accepted, and no account gets the role before
   the character is its own (Konig's review: two accounts linking the same character at the same
   moment each got the role before). Another account that linked the character meanwhile keeps
   it (`linked-elsewhere`, the code released, nobody promoted). If `promote()` fails (the player
   is not in the server, Discord is down, the network fails), or D1 cannot record the link, the
   record is taken back (the account's own character as it was before) and the code released,
   so the same link works on the next try.

Why the draw and these limits stop anyone packing the random pool: R comes from the backend's
random generator and only the M lowest prefixes of `SHA-256(R~keyId)` over the whole pool can
count, so an attacker cannot pick the keys that confirm a code and needs a large share of the
pool to hold three of those places, with only 3 codes a day per Discord account to try ("Delete
my link" gives none back: the count outlives it). `T` is
fixed and signed when the code is issued, and a key counts only if it was 7 days old by then,
so keys registered after seeing `R` cannot join the draw. One key per Discord account, keys at
least 7 days old, accounts at least 30 days old and signatures within 5 minutes make that
share slow and costly to build and stop a few friends from signing for each other at leisure,
while councillors-only mode keeps the pool out of play until it is large.

Limits and logs: 3 codes per Discord account a day (`/verify` again gets the same unused code
back); the page may submit 10 times an hour per account. Both are counted from the rows of
`codes` and `inbox_uploads`, and in `limits` too, under a keyed hash of the Discord id for a day
(codes) or an hour (links) from the first: `forgetUser` leaves those, so "Delete my link" gives
no more of either (Konig's review: it set both back to nothing, a new code and draw each time),
and `pruneLink` drops them once their window ends. Before Discord is asked, 20 times
a minute per IP address (an IPv6 one by its /64), 10 an hour per sign-in and 300 a minute in all; every bundle received
is logged in `inbox_uploads` (never the Discord token, nor an IP address), and kept 90 days
(`pruneLink`, daily); the admin and site tokens are compared in constant
time; a Worker whose
`LINK_BACKEND_SEED` and `LINK_BACKEND_PUBLIC` do not match refuses to issue codes and
certificates.

## Test vectors

These come from `web/test/fixtures/vectors.json`, made by `web/test/fixtures/make-vectors.py`
with Python's `cryptography`. They are throwaway keys whose seeds are the SHA-256 of public
labels (`"olympus-link-test:" + label`, the label being the key id, `backend`, `ca` or
`council03`, the same rule as the addon's `tests/fixtures/make-link-vectors.py`, so both sides
hold the same keys): never register one, nor put one in `LINK_CA_PUBLIC`. The same vectors check the addon (`Olympus/Ed25519.lua` signs the `ed25519` ones
byte for byte: `web/test/fixtures/lua-signatures.json`), the page and this Worker, whose tests
(`web/test/worker.test.mjs`) load the schema into SQLite, insert these codes and keys, and send
these bundles; `web/test/addon-fixtures.test.mjs` checks the addon's own sample codes,
certificates and links the same way. Ed25519 is deterministic: any correct implementation
gives these exact signatures from these seeds. `must_fail` has a non-canonical S (S + L) that
every check must refuse.

To check your Worker by hand: insert the `codes` (with their `draw_t` and `token`) and `keys`
below (for the players' bundle, also each confirmer character in `members` under its key's
owner), set `LINK_CA_PUBLIC` to `council_authority.public_hex` (its key is never inserted) and
`LINK_COUNCIL_CHARACTERS` to its key's `character`, set
the Worker's clock between the proofs' `issued` and `exp`, and `checkProof` answers `ok` for
each bundle (`acceptProof` then links it; `web/test/link-core.test.mjs` does exactly this). `tag_of` is the text whose SHA-256 starts with the tag;
`draw.thresholds` gives `T` for pools of keys `pool0000`, `pool0001`... of several sizes.

## The core

`web/worker/link-core.mjs`, the whole module: every check, and the functions your routes call
(step 3).

<!-- block: web/worker/link-core.mjs -->
```js
// Olympus Link: the core, for the Olympus bot's Worker. Everything the bot needs to issue codes,
// check the proofs the game makes, give the role through your own promote(), and keep the
// confirmers' keys, as plain functions over a D1 database. No framework, no npm package: WebCrypto
// (Ed25519, SHA-256) and fetch only, so it runs on Cloudflare Workers and on Node 20 or newer.
// web/FERN.md says how to wire it in, web/WORKER.md explains every check, web/worker/link-worker.js
// is a complete Worker built on it, and web/test runs all of it against the shared vectors.
//
// What it reads from `env` (your Worker's bindings):
//   LINK_DB              the D1 database with web/worker/schema.sql (DB when there is no LINK_DB)
//   LINK_BACKEND_SEED    secret: your bot's Ed25519 seed, base64url (scripts/link-keys.py backend)
//   LINK_BACKEND_PUBLIC  its public key, 64 hex: the addon holds the same one (ns.LINK_BACKEND_KEYS)
//   LINK_BACKEND_PREVIOUS  optional, while you rotate the backend key: the old public key, 64 hex. The
//                        certificates it signed still count until their confirmers type the renewed ones
//   LINK_CA_PUBLIC       the council authority's public key, 64 hex (two, comma-separated, while it
//                        changes): the addon author's client certifies High Councillors' keys with it
//   LINK_COUNCIL_CHARACTERS  the High Councillors' characters you accept from the council authority
//                        ("Name-Realm", comma-separated): its certificate for any other character
//                        counts for nothing. Closed by default: left out or empty, none counts
//   LINK_MODE            "c" councillors only (launch), "a" one councillor or three drawn players
//   LINK_GUILD_POLICY    "verified" (the default) or "claimed" (web/WORKER.md, "The guild check")
//   LINK_ORIGIN          the page's origin, "https://dnl-gentile.github.io" (CORS of POST /proof)
//   DISCORD_CLIENT_ID    your Discord application's id: a sign-in the page sends must be for it
//   LINK_SITE_TOKEN      optional: the token the page sends with POST /proof (a switch, not a secret)
//   LINK_ADMIN_TOKEN     secret, 32 characters or more: your own tools' (watcher inbox, keys)
//
// The functions, by what they are for:
//   codes      issueCode(env, user) -> { ok, token, command, reply }        (your /verify)
//   proofs     checkProof(env, text, { discordId })   reads only: the verdict
//              acceptProof(env, text, { discordId, promote })   checks, claims the code, records the
//              link, calls your promote(discordId) (and takes it all back if promote fails)
//              handleProof(request, env, { promote, demote })   the whole POST /proof, CORS included
//              (and a player's own "delete my link": forgetOwnLink)
//   watcher    acceptInbox(env, body, { promote }) / handleInbox(request, env, { promote })
//   keys       manageKeys(env, body) / handleKeys(request, env), registerKey, renewKey, revokeKey,
//              revokeCharacter, councilCharacters(env)
//   people     discordUser(accessToken, { clientId }), tooManyRequests(env, { ip, discordToken }),
//              forgetUser(env, discordId), pruneLink(env) (daily, from your Worker's scheduled())
//   answers    httpStatus(answer), respond(answer, headers), corsHeaders(request, env)

## The reference Worker

`web/worker/link-worker.js`, the whole module: a complete Worker on the core, with the Discord role
as its `promote()`. The `ADAPT` comment marks the one function a same-site page would connect to
its login (step 4); the GitHub Pages page never needs it.

<!-- block: web/worker/link-worker.js -->
```js
// Olympus Link: the reference Cloudflare Worker (D1 + Discord), complete, built on link-core.mjs
// (every check lives there). web/FERN.md is the short way into your own bot, web/WORKER.md
// explains every part; the tests in web/test run this exact file against the shared vectors.
//
// Bindings and settings (wrangler.toml / dashboard): link-core.mjs lists what it reads, and
//   DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN    secret: the bot that gives the role (Manage Roles, above ROLE_ID)
//   DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY   var: the application's public key, for the /verify slash command over HTTP
//   GUILD_ID, ROLE_ID    vars: the Olympus server and the role linked members get
//
// Routes:
//   POST /api/link/proof             the page (static, on GitHub Pages): {"text", "discordToken"}, CORS
//   POST /api/link/inbox             your watcher's inbox (read-inbox.mjs --post), admin token
//   POST /api/link/keys              the confirmer keys, admin token
//   POST /api/link/bot-code          a gateway bot asking for a member's code, admin token
//   POST /api/discord/interactions   /verify over HTTP interactions (Discord signs every request)
//   GET /api/link/me, POST /api/link/code, POST /api/link/submit: only for a page served from
//   this Worker's own site behind your own login (sessionUser); the GitHub Pages page uses /proof.
// Anything else returns null from handleLink, so it can sit in front of an existing router.
// scheduled(): pruneLink once a day, with a cron trigger in wrangler.toml ([triggers] crons).

## Running the tests

```sh
node --test web/test          # from the repository root (Node 22.13 or newer)
```

CI runs them on every push and pull request (`.github/workflows/tests.yml`, on Node 22 with
`node:sqlite`, and Python's `cryptography` for the key tool's tests), after the addon's checks.

They run the page's logic and its one request, the core and this Worker (D1 is `node:sqlite`
with the schema above, Discord a stub, `promote()` a recorder), the key tool, the inbox tool and
the QR reading against the shared vectors, and nothing touches the network
(`web/test/link-core.test.mjs` is the core's alone). Where the addon's `tests/fixtures` are in the checkout, they also check
the addon's sample codes, certificates and links; `OLYMPUS_ADDON_FIXTURES=<folder>` points at
another copy of them.
