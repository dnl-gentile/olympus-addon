The private key never leaves ~/.olympus. The addon carries only the public key (Sign.lua) and
checks the signature: RSA-2048, e = 3, PKCS#1 v1.5 over SHA-256. CouncilList.lua holds the lists:
it is copied to the author's own game only (never in the repository or the public zip).

"sign" writes the name list alone (HS1, ns.COUNCIL_SIGNED), as before 0.9.9. "council" reads
the council from a JSON file (~/.olympus/council.json unless a path is given):

  {"realm": "optional realm group", "public": false,
   "departments": [{"name": "Department of War", "icon": "INV_Sword_04",
                    "members": [{"name": "First Surname", "title": "Operations Director"}]}],
   "members": [{"name": "First Surname", "title": "optional"}]}

and writes two lists: the names (HS1, every name of the departments and of "members", which
0.9.8 clients read too) and the departments and titles (HT1, ns.COUNCIL_TITLES, 0.9.9):
  HT1~<time>~<realm group>~<public 0|1>~<departments>~<signature>
  <departments>: <name>^<icon>^<First Surname>=<title>,...;...   ("members": the entry with no name)
"members" are the councillors outside any department; a title and a department's icon (a game
icon's name under Interface\\Icons, or its file number) may be left out. "public": whether
everyone sees the council in the census (until then, the councillors and the author alone).

The King's Steward (1.0.0): an optional "stewards" list in the same file names the characters
who name Hands of their own beside the King's, set up for the King what only he could set up
(the treasury's keepers and what the army sees of it) and send the Crown's decrees on every
client:

  "stewards": ["First Surname-Realm", {"name": "First Surname-Realm", "faction": "Horde"}]

A plain name is the Alliance King's Steward; the Horde gets one only when the list names one
for it. The titles list carries them in an entry of its own after the departments, one per
faction ("^steward^<faction>^<First Surname-Realm>,..."): three "^" where a department has two,
so 0.9.9 clients leave it out unread and still take, show and pass on the whole list. At most 3
per faction; a name of letters with one space at most, its realm (that realm's group) or none
(any realm of the list's group). "steward" adds one to the council file (rewritten whole, the
rest kept) and signs the council at once; "steward --remove" takes him off and signs again: the
newer list ends it on every client. "check" (or --check) reads a written CouncilList.lua back,
checks both signatures with the key and prints the names, departments and Stewards it holds.

The approved guilds (1.1): guilds of Asmon's Olympus whose names the addon's name rule leaves out
(it leaves Olympian and Olympia out on purpose) count as Olympus guilds once an optional
"guilds" list in the same file names them:

  "guilds": ["Guild Name", {"name": "Guild Name", "faction": "Horde"}]

A plain name is an Alliance guild. The titles list carries them after the Stewards, one entry per
faction ("^guilds^<faction>^<Guild Name>,..."), three "^" again, so clients before 1.1 leave it out
unread. At most 20 per faction; a name of letters and spaces, 24 characters at most, as the game
allows; each once. "guild" adds one to the council file and signs the council at once; "guild
--remove" takes it off and signs again. Both print the signed titles list whole, for pasting in
game with /oly approved paste: the first member of such a guild has no other way to get it (its
addon hears nothing of Olympus until it holds it); his addon then passes it to his guild.

Every list gets a newer time than the last one signed with the key (kept in the key file as
"last_at"): clients keep a list only if it is newer than theirs, so two lists signed in the
same second both reach them. Anything the addon would not take is refused here, before anything
is signed: a "~" or "|" or a control character anywhere; a "," in a name; a "^", ";", "=" or
"," in a name, title or department of the titles list; a name or title of more than 48 bytes, a
department of more than 40; more than 30 names, or a name twice; more than 8 departments; an icon
that is not a game icon's name or number; a list longer than the addon takes.
OLYMPUS_COUNCIL_KEY, OLYMPUS_COUNCIL_OUT and OLYMPUS_COUNCIL_JSON give other paths for the key,
the lists and the council (the tests use a throwaway key in a temporary folder).
